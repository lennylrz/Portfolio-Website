            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Lenny, a 19-year-old student diving into the exciting world of coding, eager to learn and explore new horizons

            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
            <p>Hi there, I'm Lenny! My journey into coding began through my deep-seated passion for creation. Whether it's building something from scratch or finding innovative solutions to real-world problems, coding has become my canvas for turning ideas into reality.

                Beyond coding, you'll often find me immersed in the world of sports, whether it's the adrenaline rush of football and basketball or the discipline of working out. Music is another love of mine; I enjoy playing the piano and guitar, losing myself in melodies and rhythms. When it's time to unwind, I indulge in the magic of cinema, exploring different genres and narratives, all while savoring the nuances of various soundtracks.
                
                This September, I'll be embarking on a new chapter of my academic journey at ESCP in Paris, where I'll continue to pursue my passion for learning and personal growth. With fluency in Spanish, English, and German, along with a decent grasp of Italian, I embrace the beauty of language and culture, constantly seeking new avenues for connection and understanding.
                
                In essence, I'm a curious soul driven by creativity, learning, and exploration, eager to make my mark on the world while embracing every opportunity for growth and discovery along the way.
